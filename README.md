# web-scraping-python
A Jupyter notebook to scrape Wikipedia webpages using Python to create a dataset.

The complete project is detailed as a two part series:

Part 1: Describes how web scraping can be used to fetch data from a website.
Part 2: Describes how collected data can be cleaned before actual use.
NOTE: This project is for understanding how web scraping works on actual websites. If however, web scraping is needed on a website, proper permissions must be taken and terms and conditions must be followed.
